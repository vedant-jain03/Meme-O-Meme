## Inspiration 🧑‍🎨
Developers are always looking for solutions to make our lives easier, but sometimes it becomes strenous for them to continue focusing on the building solutions. A small relaxation between their work could be a hgreat help in reducing the monotonous stress as well as give them  a good laugh.

## What it does ⛳
Meme O Meme is a website solely designed for the developers who are stuck in a pike of work and get no or very less time to release their stress. This website directs them towards a short series of memes of their preference and tries to give them the relaxation they need.

## How we built it 🚧
We used ReactJS, Firebase, Figma to built this website. 

## Challenges we ran into 🩹
We had problem hosting the project on GitHub pages. It was built using react+firebase and that made it somewhat tricky to host it on ghpages. However, we fixed all the issues and hosted it on GitHub.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
We used tailwindcss for the styling and we are proud of using it. We are elated to use Github for hosting it. We have used every feature of Github available.
